export const LIFE_INSURANCE_SCRIPT_TEMPLATE = `Hi, this is Brian calling from [YOUR COMPANY NAME]. 

I'm reaching out because we help working families protect their loved ones with affordable life insurance coverage.

I have just 2 quick questions for you:

1. Do you currently have enough life insurance to cover your family's expenses if something unexpected happened to you?

2. Would you be interested in a free 15-minute consultation to see if we can get you better coverage at a lower cost?

[IF INTERESTED]
Perfect! I can schedule you with one of our licensed agents. We have appointments available tomorrow at 2 PM or Thursday at 10 AM. Which works better for you?

[IF NOT INTERESTED] 
I completely understand. Can I ask - do you feel your current coverage would be enough to pay off your mortgage and support your family for at least 5-10 years?

[OBJECTION HANDLING]
- "I already have coverage": That's great! Many people find they're either paying too much or don't have enough coverage. Our free review takes just 15 minutes.
- "I can't afford it": I hear that a lot. That's exactly why we offer this free consultation - to find coverage that fits your budget, sometimes as low as $30/month.
- "I'm too young/healthy": Actually, that's the perfect time! The younger and healthier you are, the better rates you qualify for.
